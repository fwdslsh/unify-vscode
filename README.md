- Auto-completion for include paths, slot names, and template references
- Hover information with file previews and status

### ‚ùå Error Diagnostics

## Quick Start

1. **Install the Extension** (when published)

   ```
   ext install unify.unify-preview
   ```

2. **Open a Unify Project**

   - The extension automatically activates in Unify projects
   - Looks for `@fwdslsh/unify` dependency or Unify files

3. **Preview Your Files**
   - Open any `.html` file
   - Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Unify: Open Preview"
   - Or click the preview icon in the editor toolbar

## Commands

- **Unify: Open Preview** - Open preview in current column
- **Unify: Open Preview to the Side** - Open preview in side column
- **Unify: Refresh Preview** - Manually refresh preview

## Configuration

Configure the extension through VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "unify.preview.autoRefresh": true,
  "unify.preview.debounceDelay": 200,
  "unify.preview.openToSide": true,
  "unify.sourceDirectory": "src",
  "unify.includesDirectory": "includes"
}
```

## Supported File Types

- **HTML files** (`.html`, `.htm`) - Full Unify processing
- **Markdown files** (`.md`) - With frontmatter and layout support
- **Include files** - Navigation and validation

## How It Works

The extension integrates directly with the `@fwdslsh/unify` package to provide:

1. **Real-time Processing**: Uses Unify's include processor and dependency tracker
2. **Error Detection**: Validates file paths, circular dependencies, and template structure
3. **Smart Navigation**: Resolves include paths and template references
4. **Live Updates**: Watches for file changes and updates preview automatically

## Workspace Detection

The extension automatically activates when it detects:

- `@fwdslsh/unify` in `package.json` dependencies
- Unify build scripts in `package.json`
- Unify configuration files
- HTML files with include directives

## Troubleshooting

### Preview Not Working

- Ensure you're in a Unify project
- Check that `@fwdslsh/unify` is installed
- Verify source directory configuration

### Navigation Not Working

- Check file paths in include directives
- Ensure files exist in the expected locations
- Verify workspace folder is set correctly

### Performance Issues

- Increase debounce delay in settings
- Disable auto-refresh for large projects
- Check for circular dependencies
